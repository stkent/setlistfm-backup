# setlist.fm backup script

Note: I am not a Python developer, please forgive my syntactic sins.

## Setup

Install the appropriate version of Python using e.g. `asdf`:

```shell
asdf plugin-add python
asdf install python
```

Install Pipenv:

```shell
pip install --user pipenv
```

Install dependencies from the lockfile:

```shell
pipenv sync
```

## Usage

Execute:

```shell
pipenv run python back_up_user_data.py -k API_KEY -u USERNAME
```

where

* `API_KEY` can be applied for via https://www.setlist.fm/settings/apps, and
* `USERNAME` is your setlist.fm username.

This will create a CSV file named `USERNAME_setlist.csv` in the `outputs` directory.
